# Integrate Optimizely Full Stack with Contentful

Contentful and Optimizely work together to facilitate experimentation without the need for developer involvement. This means that once it is setup, editors can run experiments on content using the Contentful web app and do not need to ask for code changes to clients. This enables a powerful and flexible workflow for editors and content managers.

## Pre-requisites

- A Contentful account with a space for your website
- An Optimizely account with a Full Stack project
- A developer to integrate the initial solution with your front end


## Instructions

Follow the [instructions](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/apps/optimizely/) on Contentful's page for this lab's instructions.
